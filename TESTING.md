### Testing and debugging
I have checked the website on www.responsinator.com. On this website you can see how your website looks on the following screen sizes on one single web page:

-iPhone eXpensive portrait · width: 375px;

-iPhone eXpensive landscape · width: 734px; 

-Android (Pixel 2) portrait · width: 412px;

-Android (Pixel 2) landscape · width: 684px;

-iPhone 6-8 portrait · width: 375px;

-iPhone 6-8 landscape · width: 667px;

-iPhone 6-8 Plump portrait · width: 414px;

-iPhone 6-8 Plump landscape · width: 736px;

-iPad portrait · width: 768px;

-iPad landscape · width: 1024px;

With this tool I have spotted some padding mistakes at the navbar along the way, which I have fixed. The website renders and looks good on all those screens.

I have used Google Chrome DevTools and Firefox DevTools for debugging;

Tested with validator.w3.org and having returned 7 errors related with the modal, which is not implemented fully yet.

I have tested the website on a numerous devices with my friends and family.

I have regularly asked for feedback from my colleagues and my mentor Simen Daehlin.

All photos have been resized through  http://tinypic.com/ for a faster loading time.

I have imported only the font weights that I have actually used. At the beginning of my project I have imported all weights, but I have found out later that it affects the loading time.

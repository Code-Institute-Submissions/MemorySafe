# MemorySafe 
[View website in GitHub Pages](https://andreeaiosip.github.io/MemorySafe)

MemorySafe is a fictional/futuristic service, which hopefully can be transformed into reality in the future – saving your memories along with the feelings and to restore them if needed. 

Nowadays we can record and take pictures, but this will bring back only visual experiences, but not the feelings, how and what you felt in that moment.

The business is 2 years old, so the reach is still restricted and mainly known in their industry – medicine and technology.

### The need: 
When people get sick, have Alzheimer, dementia or just simply because we are getting old, and memory is not as good, we lose important memories; e.g. how we felt on our first day in school, our first kiss, when our baby was born or in worse cases, we can’t recognize family members.

### The goals of this website are:
•	Promote their service;

•	Offering a step by step guide how the service works;

•	Attracting customers to book an appointment for an assessment;

•	Provide a clean feel and easy to navigate website;

## UX
After pitching my idea and interviewing family and friends with age range 27 years old – 60 years old, I have developed three potential customer personas.
I wanted to have a better structure and more visual appealing layout for the personas, so I have used https://xtensio.com/.  Please click on each persona to read more details. 

Files saved in a separate folder called *Personas*. 

1.	[Susan – The Psychologist](https://github.com/andreeaiosip/MemorySafe/blob/master/personas/susan.JPG) 
2.	[Patrick – The Neuroscientist Researcher](https://github.com/andreeaiosip/MemorySafe/blob/master/personas/patrick.JPG)
3.	[Mary (Patrick’s Mum) – The Modern Upper Class Lady](https://github.com/andreeaiosip/MemorySafe/blob/master/personas/mary.JPG)


### Common characteristics of a client:
•	Well informed and interested in technology and medicine;

•	They know about the service already from their peers, but they want to find out more;

•	Financially secure;

•	Average age 45 years old;

•	English speaker;

## Features

### Existing Features

**Navbar** for an easy navigation displayed on top of each page with a logo on the left hand side, a phone number beside the logo and four tabs: *Home, About, Contact, How it works* and a call to action button *Book Here* on the right hand side.  
The navbar is responsive –  under 768px width it transforms in a “hamburger” icon on the right hand side, phone number stays in the middle and the logo on the left hand side. The logo is linked to the home page.

**Footer** has four sections composed by Privacy, Terms & Conditions, Copyright and Social media icons (Facebook Twitter, YouTube). Is displayed on each page for the user to read more about the policies they have in place and to visit the social channels.

### Features left to implement
•	Phone number on the navbar should be made clickable and automatically to connect to skype or another service to facilitate an instant call.

•	GDPR Modal pop up window;

•	Useful FAQ about the service and process;

•	Q&A section;

•	Form to connect to PHP;

•	Geolocation for the map;

•	Copyright, Privacy and Terms & Conditions linked to the right content.

•	Translation option for other languages;

## Technologies Used
I have created this website with the help of a multiple technologies: 

•	HTML for the structure of the website;

•	CSS – to add styling to the HTML structure;

•	[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the IDE and pushing to GitHub;

•	[GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) Pages for deployment;

•	[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for pushing to GitHub, comparing the changes  and look at the history of the changes that I’ve made along the way. 

•	[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) for adding responsive elements;

•	[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) icons that I have used on the site;

•	[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for adding two font families: Raleway and Allerta Stencil;

•	[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to reference Javascript needed for the responsive navbar and the *Book Now* modal.

•	[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) – to create the wireframes.

•	[AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/xd.html) – to create prototypes of the pages and see how they link together.

•	[PhotoPad](https://www.nchsoftware.com/photoeditor/index.html) Photo editor – I have adjusted the color of the icons from the *How it works* page.

## TESTING 
###### please click on the separate document [testing.md](testing.md)
.
## Deployment
This project was developed using Visual Studio Code. It was pushed regularly through Visual Studio Code (Source Control Option) and with GitHub Desktop to GitHub repository and published to GitHub pages.

There are no differences between the deployed version and the development version.

## Credits
To change the colour of the navbar “hamburger” icon, I had to overwrite Bootstrap rules and I have found a [code](https://github.com/css/csso/issues/377) on GitHub that helped me to solve that bug.

## Content
The content on the website is all fictional and written by me. For the bios for the founders, I researched for a more medical wording and I’ve got my inspiration from ww.psychologytoday.com.

## Media
•	I have sourced photos that don’t need copyright, from Google pictures and from Unsplash.com.

•	For the icons on the How it works page, I have sourced them on Google pictures and recoloured them in Photo Editor, PhotoPad, so they will match the colour scheme of the website.

## Acknowledgements
I received inspiration, suggestions and constructive feedback from my colleagues at Code Institute, my friends and my mentor, Simen Daehlin.

# MemorySafe - Educational Project - User Centric Front End Module - Code Institute 

MemorySafe 
MemorySafe is a fictional/futuristic service, which hopefully can be transformed into reality in the future – saving your memories along with the feelings and to restore them if needed. 
Nowadays we can record and take pictures, but this will bring back only visual experiences, but not the feelings, how and what you felt in that moment.
The business is 2 years old, so the reach is still restricted and mainly known in their industry – medicine and technology.
The need: 
When people get sick, have Alzheimer, dementia or just simply because we are getting old, and memory is not as good, we lose important memories; e.g. how we felt on our first day in school, our first kiss, when our baby was born or in worse cases, we can’t recognize family members.

The goals of this website are:
-	Promote their service;
-	Offering a step by step guide how the service works;
-	Attracting customers to book an appointment for an assessment;
-	Provide a clean feel and easy to navigate website;

UX
After pitching my idea and interviewing family and friends with age range 27 years old – 60 years old, I have developed three potential customer personas.
I wanted to have a better structure and more visual appealing layout for the personas, so I have used https://xtensio.com/.  Please click on each persona to read more details. 
Files saved in a separate folder called Personas.

1.	Susan – The Psychologist 
2.	Patrick – The Neuroscientist Researcher
3.	Mary (Patrick’s Mum) – The Modern Upper Class Lady

Common characteristics of a client:
-	Well informed and interested in technology and medicine;
-	They know about the service already from their peers, but they want to find out more;
-	Financially secure;
-	Average age 45 years old;
-	English speaker;

Existing Features
•	Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
•	...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
Features Left to Implement

•	HTML 
•	CSS 
•	Visual Studio Code
•	GitHub Desktop

Testing
	I have used Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and resized the window to see how it shows on various sizes. 
	I have checked the website on www.responsinator.com.
	Tested with validator.w3.org and having returned 7 errors related with the modal, which is not implemented fully yet.
	I have tested the website on a numerous devices with my friends and family.
	I have regularly asked for feedback from my colleagues and my mentor Simen Daehlin.

Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1.	Contact form: 
1.	Go to the "Contact Us" page
2.	Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
3.	Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
4.	Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
Deployment
This project was developed using Visual Studio Code. It was pushed regularly through Visual Studio Code (Source Control Option) and with GitHub Desktop to GitHub repository and published to GitHub pages.
There are no differences between the deployed version and the development version.

Content
The content on the website is all fictional and written by me. For the bios for the founders, I researched for a more medical wording and I’ve got my inspiration from ww.psychologytoday.com.

•	The text for section Y was copied from the Wikipedia article Z
Media
•	Photos are sourced from google pictures which don’t require copyright and Unsplashed website. 
•	For the icons on the How it works page, I have sourced them on Google pictures and recoloured them in Photo Editor, so they will have the same color and match the color scheme of the website.

Acknowledgements
•	I received inspiration for this project from omy colleague at Code Institute, my mentor, Simen Dilah.
